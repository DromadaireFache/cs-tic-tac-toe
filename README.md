# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C#. It is a terminal-based application and serves as my first experience with C# programming. The game allows two players to take turns and play Tic Tac Toe in the terminal.

Additionally, the game includes a bot that the user can toggle. The bot is implemented with a simple minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, providing a challenging opponent for solo play.
